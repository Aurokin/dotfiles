# Dotfiles

These dotfiles use the Tokyo Night, night edition, whenever possible.

If you are starting your own dotfiles I recommend using these as reference.
I started my neovim configuration with https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim

Outside of neovim, I use stow to link my dotfiles https://dr563105.github.io/blog/manage-dotfiles-with-gnu-stow/
